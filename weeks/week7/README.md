### Assignments
**Assignment 1: Comprehensive RAG System**

Specific Task: Build a small-scale RAG system for answering factual questions

Deliverables:

- Vector database setup with a small subset of Wikipedia articles (e.g., 1000 articles on a specific topic)
- Basic chunking and embedding strategy
- Basic retrieval and generation pipeline
- Simple web interface for questions

Success Criteria: System successfully retrieves relevant context and generates reasonable answers

**Assignment 2: Task Completion Agent**

Specific Task: Enhance the RAG system with agent capabilities

Deliverables:

- Build upon the previous RAG implementation
- Add 2-3 basic tools (e.g., router, search query refinement, calculator)
- Implement a basic reasoning step before generating answers
- Create a simple way to log the agent's steps

Success Criteria: Successfully use tools to enhance answers when appropriate
