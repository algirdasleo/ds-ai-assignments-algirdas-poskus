## Week 2: ML Intro

### Unsupervised Learning: Principal Component Analysis and Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- k-means clustering
- Affinity Propagation
- Spectral clustering
- Agglomerative clustering
- accuracy metrics

### Some aspects of ML:
- Stochastic gradient descent and online learning
- Categorical feature processing
- Multiclass classification

### Time series analysis in Python:
- introduction to time series, theoretical aspects
- exponential smoothing
- double exponential smoothing
- triple exponential smoothing a.k.a. Holt-Winters
- time series cross validation
- Econometric approach: Stationarity, ARIMA-family Crash-Course
- Linear (and not only) models for time series: Feature extraction, 
   Time series lags, Target encoding, Regularization and feature selection

### Gradient Boosting:
- Introduction in boosting
- GBM algorithm: Functional gradient descent, Friedmanâ€™s classic GBM algorithm
- Loss functions: Regression loss functions, Classification loss functions

### Task:
- to do:
- Preparing the data.
- Cleaning the data.
- Normalizing, scaling the data.
- Calculating summary statistics to understand the underlying trends and distributions in the data.
- Visualizing the data using graphs, charts, and histograms to identify any patterns or anomalies in the data.
- Exploring correlations between variables.
- Selecting at least three machine learning algorithms.
- Training the models.
- Performing cross-validation.
- Performing grid search.
- Interpreting the results.
